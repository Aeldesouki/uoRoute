Product Description:

A web application to make the job of a new University of Ottawa student's life easier. Students can sign in through their uoZone account and it will sync with their personal information and course schedule. In the graphical interface, the app shows multiple map levels of the campus, showcasing facilities, classrooms, and internal tunnels and overpasses that connect the buildings.

Syncing their schedule with uoZone allows the product to send regular automated notification reminding students of their timesheet while helping them navigate to their classes. And when they're done, it will send them to the local restaurants and cafes for a well deserved break.
